### Description
This is a C# solution for a vending machine that accepts only 50p coins but is able to dispense correct change in correct denominations.

- The vending machine must be allow users to request a product (or products) and deposit the correct number of 50p coins

- The vending machine must respond to show that the correct product is provided along with the correct change


#### Design
I separated the responsibilities of the vending machine in to three classes - Vending Machine, Product and Calculator. They are described below.

| Class  | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
|   \|  \ |


#### Considerations
- Wrong Coins being inserted
- Matching of input string requesting a product
- Incorrect product requests

#### Further Developments
I would like to extract the product inventory out to a separate class.
